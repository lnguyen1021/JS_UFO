## JS_UFO
Using mock data, this project focuses on dynamically creating tables using JSON objects and DOM manipulation. The objective was allow users to query the UFO database and return a table to the user based on the select criteria.
### Challenges/ to-do
I was able to tackle the date query which returns a table based on matching date. However, I had difficulties creating a section that allowed users to select multiple options to query.
